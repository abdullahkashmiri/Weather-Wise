# Weather-Wise: Flutter API Integration

**Weather-Wise** is a Flutter-based project that integrates a weather API to provide real-time weather information. It offers users the ability to search for weather data by location, displaying current conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather summary. 

The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Using Dart and Flutter's HTTP package, the app fetches data from a weather API, parses the JSON response, and presents it in a clear, readable format. Additionally, it includes error handling for invalid searches or network issues.

## Features:
- Real-time weather updates
- Search by city/location
- Display current temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## API Integration:
1. The app uses a third-party weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap).
2. Flutterâ€™s HTTP library manages requests and responses.
3. JSON data is parsed to display weather details.

Weather-Wise demonstrates how to integrate APIs in Flutter applications and is a great starting point for developers interested in building data-driven mobile apps.
